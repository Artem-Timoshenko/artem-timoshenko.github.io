I study how data, experimentation, and algorithms are transforming the way firms innovate, engage customers, and make strategic decisions. My research bridges marketing, product development, and applied machine learning. I work closely with industry partners to identify high-impact challenges, design proof-of-concept studies, and conduct large-scale field experiments that deliver actionable insights. Recent projects explore how generative AI is reshaping innovation pipelines and how smarter targeting and personalization can accelerate marketing effectiveness.
