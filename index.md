  <p>I am an Associate Professor at the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu" target="_blank">Kellogg School of Management</a> at Northwestern University.</p>

  <p>My research examines how emerging technologies are transforming innovation, customer engagement, and marketing strategies. Current projects explore how generative AI is reshaping new product development and how data-driven personalization can accelerate marketing effectiveness. I work closely with industry partners to identify high-impact challenges, propose new methodological solutions, and design proof-of-concept studies that deliver actionable insights. </p>
