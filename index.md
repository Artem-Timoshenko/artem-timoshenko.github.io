  <p>I am an Associate Professor at the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu" target="_blank">Kellogg School of Management</a> at Northwestern University. My research examines how data, experimentation, and algorithms are transforming the way firms innovate, engage customers, and make strategic decisions. </p>

  <p>My recent projects explore how generative AI is reshaping innovation pipelines and how smarter personalization can accelerate marketing effectiveness. I work closely with industry partners to identify high-impact challenges, design proof-of-concept studies, and conduct large-scale field experiments that deliver actionable insights. </p>
