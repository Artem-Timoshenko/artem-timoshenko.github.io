  <p>I am an Associate Professor at the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu" target="_blank">Kellogg School of Management</a> at Northwestern University.</p>

  <p>My research examines how emerging technologies are reshaping innovation, customer engagement, and marketing strategies. Current projects focus on how generative AI can facilitate new product development and on using data-driven personalization to accelerate marketing effectiveness. I collaborate closely with industry partners to identify high-impact challenges, develop novel methodological approaches, and design proof-of-concept studies that generate actionable insights.</p>
