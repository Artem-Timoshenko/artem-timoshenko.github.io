  <p>I am an Associate Professor at the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu">Kellogg School of Management</a> at Northwestern University.</p>

  <p>My <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link menu/research.md %}">research</a> examines how data, experimentation, and algorithms are transforming the way firms innovate, engage customers, and make strategic decisions. I work closely with industry partners to identify high-impact challenges, design proof-of-concept studies, and conduct large-scale field experiments that deliver actionable insights. Recent projects explore how generative AI is reshaping innovation pipelines and how data-driven personalization can accelerate marketing effectiveness.</p>
